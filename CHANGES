Changes
=======

Version 0.2.0 (released 2020-05-25)

- Adds Python 3 support.

Version 0.1.6 (released 2019-08-01)

- Fixes issue with reading all remaining data the last part of a
  large file (2GB+).

Version 0.1.5 (released 2017-07-18)

- Fixes an issue where the xrootd response was not checked when closing
  a file. This could ultimately result in masking very important errors
  that could lead to silent data loss (such as not reporting that the
  server had a problem replicating the file and thus deleted the file).

Version 0.1.4 (released 2017-05-04)

- Pins PyFilesystem dependency as v2+ is incompatible with XRootDPyFS.

Version 0.1.3 (released 2016-09-12)

- Allows negative seek offsets from the end of the binary files.

Version 0.1.2 (released 2016-08-19)

- Fixes issue with generated root url when query string was present.

Version 0.1.1 (released 2015-10-09)

- Changed package name from xrootdfs to xrootdpyfs due to naming conflict
  with XRootD FUSE.

Version 0.1.0 (released 2015-09-29)

- Initial public release.
